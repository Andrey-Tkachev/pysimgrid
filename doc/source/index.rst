pysimgrid is a framework aimed mainly to simplify DAG scheduling algorithm development, testing and benchmarking.
It is based on a awesome SimGrid library that provides a reliable simulation core which complemented by python's
ease of development and wide array of libraries (import antigravity, anyone?).

Current features:

* Simulation of DAG execution on a distributed network
* Array of popular scheduling algorithms (see :ref:`simdag_algorithms`)
* Convenience tools for experiments (batch/parallel execution, platform/DAG generation)
